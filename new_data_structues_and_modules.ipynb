    "## New: Data Structures and Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook covers **tuples**, **lists**, and **modules** for Year 11.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Lists and Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports several data structures such as **lists** and **tuples** to organise data efficiently in our programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is a list?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists are mutable, meaning they can be edited, and ordered group of data items. Creating a list in Python is very simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "print(fruits)\n",
    "fruits.append(\"orange\")  # adds an element\n",
    "print(fruits)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is a tuple?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples are immutable, meaning they cannot be edited, and ordered group of data items. Creating a tuple in Python is also very simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "coordinates = (4, 5)\n",
    "print(coordinates)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Common Operations on Lists and Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to create these data structures to be able to access the data and process is efficiently. In a list or tuple, we can access individual data items using the `[]` and specifying the **position** which always starts from **zero**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Accessing data in a list or tuple**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "first_fruit = fruits[0]\n",
    "print(first_fruit) # prints apple\n",
    "\n",
    "second_coordinate = coordinates[1]\n",
    "print(second_coordinate) # prints 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since lists are editable, Python offers various built-in functions to make processing them easier. Here is a list of functions you need to know about:\n",
    "- `append(item)` - adds an item at the end of a list\n",
    "- `remove(item)` - removes a particular data item from the list\n",
    "- `len(list)` - gives you the length of a list\n",
    "- `sort()` - sorts the list"

    "### 3. Looping Through Lists and Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use `for` loops to access each element in a list or tuple using the `in` operator. Here are some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Looping through a list**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "for fruit in fruits:\n",
    "    print(\"I like\", fruit)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Looping through a tuple**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "colors = (\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\")\n",
    "for color in colors:\n",
    "    print(color, \"is a nice color\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The only disadvantage of the using the `in` operator is that we lose the position of the data item. If we need the position of the data item for some reason or other then we need to use a different approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using `range()` and indexing with lists**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40]\n",

    "### 4. Modules and Imports\n",
    "\n",
    "A **module** is a Python file that contains code (functions and variables) you can `import` into another program. We normally do so at the very top of our programs. Python comes with many modules, but, the one you really need to know about at this stage is the **Random** module. We introduce it here because it is most useful with lists!\n",
